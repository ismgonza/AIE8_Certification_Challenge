# üìò ISO 27002 - What It Is and Why You Don't Need Separate Controls

## TL;DR

**You already have ISO 27002!** üéâ

ISO 27002 is **not** a separate standard with different controls. It's the **implementation guide** for ISO 27001 Annex A controls.

---

## What's the Difference?

### ISO 27001:2022
- ‚úÖ **Certification Standard** - You get certified against this
- ‚úÖ **Requirements** - Tells you WHAT you must do
- ‚úÖ **Annex A** - 93 controls (organized in 4 themes)

### ISO 27002:2022
- üìñ **Code of Practice** - Implementation guidance
- üìñ **How-To Guide** - Tells you HOW to implement the controls
- üìñ **Same Controls** - The exact same 93 controls from ISO 27001 Annex A

**The RAG system uses BOTH PDFs together:**
- When you ask about a control (e.g., 5.15 Access Control)
- It retrieves context from **both** documents
- ISO 27001 PDF: Requirement and control statement
- ISO 27002 PDF: Detailed implementation guidance

### Example: Control 5.15 (Access Control)

**ISO 27001 says:**
> "Rules to control physical and logical access to information and other associated assets shall be established and implemented based on business and information security requirements."

**ISO 27002 says:**
> Here's HOW to do it:
> - Establish access control policy
> - Define access rights
> - Implement need-to-know principle
> - Manage special access rights
> - Review access rights regularly
> - Document everything
> - [Plus 3 more pages of detailed guidance]

**Your Implementation Guide combines both!** üéØ

## Why Only 25 Controls in Code?

You might wonder: "ISO 27001/27002 have 93 controls, but `iso_27001_controls.py` only has 25?"

**Answer:** These are **curated starter controls** for the dashboard UI to:
1. Focus on high-priority items first
2. Cover all 4 themes (organizational, people, physical, technological)
3. Keep the dashboard manageable for small-medium businesses

**The RAG system has access to ALL 93 controls** via the uploaded PDFs!

---

## Do You Need to Add ISO 27002 Controls Separately?

**No!** Here's why:

### ‚ùå Wrong Approach:
```python
# DON'T DO THIS
iso_27001_controls.py  # 25 controls
iso_27002_controls.py  # Same 25 controls again (duplicate!)
```

### ‚úÖ Correct Approach (What You Have):
```python
# This is correct:
iso_27001_controls.py  # 25 key controls for dashboard
# Both PDFs in vector DB for comprehensive RAG answers
```

---

## What About the Other 68 Controls?

You have two options:

### Option 1: Add More to Dashboard (Recommended)
If you want all 93 controls in the dashboard:

```python
# Expand iso_27001_controls.py to include all 93:
"organizational": [
    # Add 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.8-5.14, 5.19-5.22, 5.24-5.29, 5.31-5.37
    ...
],
"people": [
    # Add 6.4-6.8
    ...
],
# etc.
```

### Option 2: Use RAG for Others (Current)
The RAG system can already answer questions about **any** of the 93 controls because both PDFs are uploaded:

```bash
# You can ask about ANY control, even ones not in the dashboard:
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "How do I implement ISO 27001 control 5.4 Management Responsibilities?"
  }'
```

## Summary

| Aspect | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| ISO 27001 Standard | ‚úÖ Uploaded | PDF in `/data` |
| ISO 27002 Guide | ‚úÖ Uploaded | PDF in `/data` |
| Controls in Dashboard | ‚úÖ 25 controls | High-priority subset |
| Controls in RAG | ‚úÖ All 93 | Via uploaded PDFs |
| Need separate ISO 27002 module? | ‚ùå No | Already covered! |

---

## Quick Actions

### 1. Verify Both PDFs Are Uploaded
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/documents?limit=10
# Should show chunks from both PDFs
```

### 2. Test a Non-Dashboard Control
```bash
# Ask about control 5.4 (not in dashboard, but in PDFs)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/query \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "question": "How do I implement ISO 27001 control 5.4?"
  }'
```

### 3. Add More Controls to Dashboard (Optional)
Edit `backend/standards/iso_27001_controls.py` and add more controls using the same format.

**Bottom Line:** You don't need to add ISO 27002 separately. It's already working behind the scenes in your RAG system! üöÄ

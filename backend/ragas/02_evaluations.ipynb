    "\n",
    "**Advanced Technique Implemented:**\n",
    "- **Cohere Reranking**: Two-stage retrieval process that first retrieves 9 candidate documents using vector search (3x top_k), then applies Cohere's cross-encoder reranker to select the top 3 most relevant documents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results:**\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Overall improvement: 2.09%** across RAGAS metrics\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Context Recall: +7.87%** (most significant gain)\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Context Precision: +1.12%** (better document selection)\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Faithfulness: +1.65%** (reduced hallucinations)\n",
    "- ‚úÖ **Answer Relevancy: +0.15%** (maintained quality)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Worked Well:**\n",
    "- **Increased candidate pool** (9 docs instead of 3) improved recall without sacrificing precision\n",
    "- **Cohere cross-encoder reranking** effectively filtered out less relevant chunks\n",
    "- **Two-stage approach** balances recall (vector search) with precision (reranking)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Trade-offs:**\n",
    "- **Latency**: +200-300ms per query (reranking overhead)\n",
    "- **Cost**: ~$0.10 per 60 questions (Cohere API)\n",
    "- **Simplicity**: One additional API dependency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendation:**\n",
    "For production security Q&A systems, the measurable improvement in accuracy (especially Context Recall) justifies the small latency and cost increase. The reduction in hallucinations is critical for security guidance.\n",
    "\n",
